Create a station on Wandering (http://thewandering.net) through your blog, and insert it's QR code and link at the end of a post.

== Description ==

By using this plugin, you will be able to create a station in "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" system, without leaving your blog. This means that you will use a wizard on your blog, instead of "Wandering" standard wizard.

The station created in your blog will be stored in "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" database, and will be accessible as any other station is - using your email as the developer's email, your name as the developer's name, the post's title as the station's name, and the information you enter in the wizard.

When you complete the wizard, the station will be created in "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" system, and you will have a link and a QR code added to the end of your post, enabling your readers to view the station on "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" system.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or your customized plugin directory)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the setting page and define under what name and email you will build the stations in your blog. It's recommended to choose an email with an existing "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" account, or to create an account for it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't have an account in "Wandering", does that matter? =

You can build stations even if you don't have an account, but having one will enable you to edit them later

= How do I edit a station? =

Just login to "[Wandering](http://thewandering.net/ "Wandering")" using the email that was used to build the station (you can create one or use a Google/Facebook/Live account attached to that email) and go to "My Stations". You will see there a station with the title of your post title, click "edit" and use the editor.

= I don't see any changes in my post after creating the station =

The editing section will not show you the station, you should open the link to the actual post - you will see the link and QR code added at the end of the post.

= I want to change the name and email of the station builder =

Just go to the settings page and change it there.

= I want to delete the link and QR code from my post! == I want to delete the link and QR code from my post! =
